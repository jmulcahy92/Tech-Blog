# Tech Blog

## Description

This app emulates the basic structure of a blog-style website, complete with the ability to sign up, log in, create/delete posts of your own, and view existing posts. Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully implement the ability to update posts or create comments, though much of the code to accomplish this DOES exist in the repo. One CAN view comments on posts that have been seeded into the database. I also did not have enough time to add any css or refine the html, so the aesthetics of the site are lacking as well.

The instructor and TA provided starter code files as shown in the following screenshot:

The app utilizes the Model-View-Controller paradigm, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for authentication. It is deployed on Heroku at the link below.
